About a week and a half ago, I started the lifelong journey of becoming a great software developer. The first twelve weeks of this excursion are being spent here in Atlanta with The Iron Yard. In short, The Iron Yard is a software development school that aims to take people with little to no software development experience, and turn them into entry level developers in just 12 weeks. Since I am blogging about this experience from start to finish, it seems appropriate that I should first discuss the most basic question one might ask. Why? Why am I becoming a software developer and why did I choose The Iron Yard.

Before I discuss why I chose The Iron Yard as the place to begin a career as a developer, I’ll tell you why I want to be a software developer in the first place. The reasons are many, but for the sake of brevity, I’ll list the most important ones.


   * It allows me to be simultaneously creative and logical. One of the biggest things I didn’t enjoy about my previous career was that it didn’t seem to allow room for any creativity, only logic. When approaching a programming problem, particularly with Ruby, there can be many different solutions. This allows me to express my creative nature in the form of a logical solution to a problem.
   * The process of building and eventually finishing a program gives me a unique sense of accomplishment that I haven’t experienced in any other endeavor.
   * I love technology, because when it is implemented correctly, it allows us to spend more time on what really matters in our lives.
   * Being able to code is the closest you can get to having super powers.

Now for the reasons I chose The Iron Yard.


   * Going back to college for a CS degree seemed impractical, to time consuming, and way to expensive. Teaching myself seemed pretty cheap, but would probably take even longer than getting another degree, and it’s likely that I would pick up some bad habits in the process. The Iron Yard focuses on teaching good coding habits and is fully immersive. When I say fully immersive, I mean it requires your attention full time and then some.
   * They teach Ruby on Rails. Ruby is a language that focuses on developer productivity. It has an incredibly strong community surrounding it, and frameworks like Rails allow you to build great apps quick, fast, and in a hurry. It is also very popular which bodes well for the job applications I’ll be sending out.
   * They put their money where their mouth is. They were one of the only programs of this type that I had ever seen that would give me my tuition back if I wasn't able to get a job offer within six months of successfully completing the program. This wasn’t just put up on their webpage to attract attention. It was explicitly stated in the contract I signed. Doing this directly ties my success in getting a job to their success as a business, which is one gutsy move for a business to make. Without personally knowing the leaders at The Iron Yard, I don’t know of anything else they could do to express more confidence in what they are able to teach in 12 weeks.

I’m sure that in another ten and a half weeks I’ll have more to say on both of the above topics, but this should do it for a first ever blog post. Thanks for reading.
